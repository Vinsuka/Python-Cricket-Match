# Python-Cricket-Match

Objective

You are instructed to create a command line application to maintain player and team performances during a T20 
cricket tournament. Tournament consists of a one major round. During the round, all teams that are placed in the 
same group compete each other. Further, the tournament consists of two groups (Group A, Group B). Each group 
has 4 teams. Overall there will be 8 teams.


Tasks

All the functionalities mentioned below needs to be fully implemented. You can create a command line menu to 
navigate 
• Store information about teams and players. You have freedom to decide what you need to store exactly. 
But player and team profiles needs to be realistic and updated after each match. Also you are not allowed 
to start the league without properly finalizing team and player profiles.

• Before the league starts, the user can delete/edit player and team profiles and system needs to give 
separate options for each and every functionality. Also you cannot execute these options after starting the 
tournament.

• Generate random match: Once again, the generations need to be realistic and follow the rules of cricket. 
There should not be any option to add match information manually. Starting from the toss, everything 
about the game needs to be random (no hardcoded snippets). The team who won the toss takes the 
decision (Ball first or bat first). Then program initiates the first innings. Scores of each batsman, balls took 
for scoring, wickets by bowlers, overs, fall of wickets, the method of the dismissal, final score of the innings 
will be decided by your algorithm. Next the second innings start and as explained above the algorithm needs 
to generate random figures. 

• Display match summary for a given match. 

• Store team/player and match information in a text file. You are not allowed to use a database here.

• Load team/player and match data once you restart the application.

• At a given time the program needs to display the best 5 batsmen(highest run scorers of the tournament) 
and the bowlers(highest wicket takers) 

• At a given time application needs to display the tournament standings. You can arrange the teams based 
on the match winnings.
